  nice design
* PhyD3 	interactive phylogenetic tree visualization with numerical annotation graphs, with SVG or PNG output, implemented in D3.js 	[11] 	[8]
* Phylodendron 	different tree styles, branch styles and output graphical formats 	[12] 	
* PhyloExplorer 	a tool to facilitate assessment and management of phylogenetic tree collections. Given an input collection of rooted trees, PhyloExplorer provides facilities for obtaining statistics describing the collection, correcting invalid taxon names, extracting taxonomically relevant parts of the collection using a dedicated query language, and identifying related trees in the TreeBASE database. 	[13] 	[9]
* Phylo.io 	View and compare up to 2 trees side by side with interactive HTML5 visualisations 	[14] 	[10]
* Phyloviewer 	web-based integrated environment for phylogenomic analysis based on the Bioinformatics Portal System 	[15] 	
* PhyloWidget 	view, edit, and publish phylogenetic trees online; interfaces with databases 	[16] 	[11]
* TRED 	a tool to visualize and edit phylogenetic trees. Combines a browser-based Javascript client with a Python (web2py) server. Trees are rendered in SVG using Raphael. 	[17] 	
* Treedraw 	HTML5 canvas based phylogenetic tree viewer 	[18] 	
* TreeViz 	Java tree viewer that does treemaps as well 	[19] 	
* T-REX (Webserver) 	Tree inference and visualization (hierarchical, radial and axial tree views), Horizontal gene transfer detection and HGT network visualization 	[20] 	[12]
* Microreact 	Link, visualise and explore sequence and meta-data using phylogenetic trees, maps and timelines. 	[21] 	
* PHYLOViZ Online 	Web-based tool for visualization, phylogenetic inference, analysis and sharing of minimum spanning trees 	[22] 	[13]
